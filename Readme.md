## Features

- Supports searching for various topics.
- Dark Mode and Light Mode.
- Relatively fast, tested with 30 documents (~40mb).
- Ability to use Inclusion operators ('^'), Exclusion operators ('!'), and Proximity operators ('~').
- Possibility to return suggestions once the query is processed and determined to be incorrect or nonexistent in the Corpus.
- Displays small sections of the documents where the requested content was found.
- Displays the Score assigned to each document based on the query.

## How to

Open a terminal and execute:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ARKye03/Moogle-Reimagined.git
```

Clone this repository then `'cd' to /Moogle-Reimagined/script/` in a terminal:

```shell
chmod +x start_searching.sh
```

Then with bash or zsh execute to display info:

```shell
./start_searching.sh --help
```

Btw it won't work with only one archive in the "Content" folder
